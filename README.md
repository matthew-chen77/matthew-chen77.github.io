    <h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
    <p>
      The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break 
      work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
      It helps you stay focused and prevents burnout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pomodoro" refers to the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. Named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer he used, the technique involves working in focused "pomodoro" sessions, taking short breaks after each one, and a longer break after four sessions, to improve productivity, focus, and reduce stress.  
<strong>Benefits</strong>
Improves focus and concentration: by working in short bursts and taking regular breaks. 
Boosts productivity: by breaking down tasks and managing time more effectively. 
Reduces stress and anxiety: by providing a structured framework for tackling large amounts of work. 
Increases motivation: by making tasks feel more manageable and providing a sense of accomplishment with each completed pomodoro. 
<strong>When to Use It</strong>
The technique is well-suited for tasks requiring sustained focus, such as studying, writing, or coding, and can be used on top of other productivity practices.
